I'm currently wrapping up my BS in Computer Science at SNHU, with an anticipated degree completion date of 12/18/2022! I'm currently working on
several academic and personal projects that will be added here, on GitHub, as they begin to come together. Working hard to learn, and hone, skills 
that will aid me in my transition into a career in software engineering.
